# Hugo  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear Blog ‚ú® Neo

> Free, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging.

[English](./README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./doc/README_zh.md)

üß∏ A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev).

Transplanted from [Hugo Bear Blog][hugo-bearblog], because the original author chose to maintain consistency with the root original [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev), so I chose to create a more extensible and feature-rich [Hugo Bear Blog][hugo-bearblog].
